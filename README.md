Cardiovascular Disease Analysis

The goal of a health system is to protect and improve the health of people. Ministries and NGOs play a vital
role in financing, managing resources and advancement of healthcare.
A differential diagnosis (DDx) is a method of analysis of a patient's history and physical examination to
arrive at a diagnosis that best fits the symptoms presented by the patient.
It is a systematic diagnostic method used to identify the presence of a disease where multiple alternatives
are possible. This method usually employs algorithms, similar to the process of elimination by using
evidence such as symptoms, patient history and lab reports.
Health Care DDx system is an effective diagnostic tool designed to give precise and quick results thus
saving a lot of time for medical personnel. The concept includes many different cardiovascular diseases.
The dataset was generated using a base dataset which was then enhanced to form a much bigegr dataset which was then used to
make a machine learning model and give the results. The enhancement was done after rigorous research from following various
papers published online and other trusted sources.

Diseases which the model will be able to predict are:

##### ● Cardiovascular Disease
##### ● Hypertension
##### ● Type II Diabetes
##### ● Stroke

The Website folder contains the templates and pages for the website as well as the flask .py file for integration with the ML model with the dataset we made.
The notebook .ipynb file is also updated and contains the process of feature selection and model evaluation.
